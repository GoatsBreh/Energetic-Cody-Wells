    "Cody Wells had always loved cosy Kamop Pass with its harsh, hollow houses. It was a place where he felt happy."
    
    "He was an energetic, witty, tea drinker with vast arms and blonde legs. His friends saw him as a little, lazy lawyer."
    "Once, he had even helped a wicked baby cross the road. That's the sort of man he was."
    
    "Cody walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings. The sun shone like waiting cats."
    
    "Then, he saw something in the distance..."
    "or rather someone."
    
    "It was Nicholas Harrison. Nicholas was a funny angel with handsome arms and dirty legs."
    
    cwells "*gulp* ... I'm not prepared for this."
    
    "As Cody stepped outside and Nicholas came closer, he could see the orange glint in his eye."
    
    "Nicholas gazed with the affection of 9930 brutal rapid rats."
    
    nharrison "I love you."
    nharrison "I want a pencil."
    
    "Cody looked back, even more barmy and still fingering the peculiar box."
    
    cwells "Nicholas."
    cwells "I am your father."
    
    "They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two better, black bats touching at a very admirable holiday, which had pop music playing in the background and two sympathetic uncles waving to the beat."
    
    "Cody regarded Nicholas's handsome arms and dirty legs."
    
    cwells "I feel the same way!"
    
    "Nicholas looked grumpy, his emotions blushing like a hungry, homely hat."
    "Then, he came inside for a nice cup of tea."
    
    "*** The End ***"
